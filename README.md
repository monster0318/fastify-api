```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run prisma:seed
npm run dev
```

2. Default seed user: `founder@example.com` / `password123`

3. API examples (use cookie jar to store session):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"founder@example.com","password":"password123"}' -c cookiejar
curl -b cookiejar http://localhost:4000/api/company
curl -X POST -b cookiejar http://localhost:4000/api/kyc/verify
```
